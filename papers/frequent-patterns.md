# Producing statistics from corpus: frequent patterns

Tiange told me about a question regarding the most "useful" patterns that can be used to query a corpus. I am not sure that it makes sense to ask musicologists, because it would not really yield an objective reference (and I not really sure they have already sth in mind).

However, it made me think that it would be quite useful to produce, by corpus, a list of the most frequent patterns of size *s*, with *s* ranging from, say 5 to 12 (?). This would give us a robust indicator on the selectivity of patterns, and could guide our performance study.
